      'Augustine thought quite deeply about the Trinity! He strongly believed that "one God is one divinely named Trinity" (Augustine, Sermon on Faith). He saw the Trinity of divine persons as the "supreme good," accessible to minds that are purified (Augustine, De Trinitate, Book ii).  He also described God as being "absolutely and altogether simple" (Augustine, De Trinitate, Book 4, Chapter 6, Section 7) even while being a Trinity, and that the Father is the "Principle of the whole Deity" (Augustine, De Trinitate, Book 4, Chapter 20).  A significant part of his thought involved seeing a "trace of the Trinity" present in creation, particularly in the human soul or mind. He identified this image in the mind as consisting of mind, knowledge, and love (Augustine, De Trinitate, Book 9, Chapter 4). He related this concept to intellectual vision and how knowing God creates a likeness of Him in us (Augustine, De Trinitate, Book 5).  It\'s worth noting that while the human mind reflects the Trinity, Augustine also pointed out that the Son alone is called the "image of the Father" (Augustine, De Trinitate, Book 6, Chapter 2).';
